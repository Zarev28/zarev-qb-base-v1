# zarev-qb-base-v1
Hello, friends. I would like to introduce you my project for base startup roleplay server built on QBCore framework for my community on Zarev's FiveM Hub, where you can also take a part
and see a lot of my work and also paid FiveM roleplay servers that are made into the next level. This server will receive constant updates monthly and I will slowly add some things and fix issues
when somebody open a request, fast as possible so I can ensure one great startup roleplay for everybody on github.

Dependencies:
XAMMP on your computer installed.
FXServer Windows artifacts to be installed on your computer.

Installation steps:

Import the database that I provided to your phpmyadmin/heidisql, it's called: zarev-qb-v1-base.sql
Run the txadmin setup and choose existing server files to the folder, where you extracted the server.
Change the key on the server with your own from keymaster.fivem.net
Enjoy your new base startup server!
